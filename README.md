# Super Animal Royale Data Exploration

There's a popular Battle-Royale style video game on Steam called [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com/), which my friends and I enjoy. There are statistics tracked in the game, and I wanted some way to visualize my statistics. I put together some simple scripts which scrapes data from the Super Animal Royale database ([which itself is scraped here](https://royale.pet/)) and plots my own data, my best friend's data, and our data relative to some approximation of the population. 

## Highlights

### Full Data from Scraped Accounts
